# Telescopic Tube Clamp

This repository contains parts for building a fan duct for the Fractal Design R4 case.

## Motivation

My computer was too noisy so I decided to experiment with ducted cooling directly to the GPU.

## Parts Required

The clamp is designed for the Fractal Design R4 case, but could work with any case by adjusting the parameters.

- 140mm Fan.

## Instructions

### Duct

Print the duct and attach to fan. Attach fan to side of case. Take care not to damage any cables or hardware when sliding case panel into place.
